Interview Concepts
1. You should be comfortable with the idea of averages, percentiles, distributions, deriving metrics, and hypothesis testing.
So for instance if you’re asked to analyze two marketing campaigns and pick the better one, you should be able to propose calculating the CTR and using a Z test or something to make sure the difference is significant.
2. How do you find the harmonic mean?
3. How to understand if a new feature is statistically significant.

Set up an AB test experiment with a testable hypothesis.

If a marketing AB test concludes and the conversion rate is (random number) 5% in the test group and and 3% in the control group and is statistically significant with a p value of .05. Can you tell a marketer that you should make the change to the new feature and that you should expect the 5% uplift? (Prob discuss utilizing error bars and to understand what is the confidence interval to address how the 5% is a point estimate within a normal distribution aka the "most likely outcome" is how I would go about discussing this.)
4. My next question (as an interviewer) would be: “how do you know the distribution is normal? How and why would you check that?”.

Most people know enough to say normal distribution, few but the good ones will know why and how to check for a normal distribution, and what to do if it isn’t normal.
5. Some more information on the role would help us give you meaningful advice. Is it as a data analyst for finance operations? Marketing operations? Logistics?

The advice will vary widely between niches. I’m in marketing and the most common analysis that we do is A/B testing, multi-variable time series trend analysis, correlation coefficient calculations, and probability estimations. Occasionally we use P-values and Z-scores for data cleaning and validation.
